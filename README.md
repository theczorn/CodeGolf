# CodeGolf
This repo contains a collection of code golf projects I've tinkered around with.

The object of code golf is to solve a given project in as few characters as possible. Acceptable solutions may be further constrained by the following:
- Languages Allowed
- Memory/Size
- Execution Time
- Language Features (functions, libraries, etc.)

**NOTE:** For readability purposes, white spaces have been preserved. Any submissions of these items would have all necessary whitespaces stripped.
